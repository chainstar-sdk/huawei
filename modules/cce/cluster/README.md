Certainly! Let's go through the code and its corresponding explanations:

```hcl
module "eks" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws"
  version = "18.26.6"

  cluster_name    = local.cluster_name
  cluster_version = "1.23"

  cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs = ["42.61.76.194/32", "151.192.59.242/32", "52.192.48.232/32"]

  vpc_id     = module.vpc.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets
```

In this section, the code is using the `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws` module version `18.26.6` to create an AWS EKS cluster. The module source specifies the location of the module to be used.

The `cluster_name` variable is set to the value of the `local.cluster_name` variable. This value is used to provide a name for the EKS cluster.

The `cluster_version` variable is set to `"1.23"`. This specifies the desired Kubernetes version for the EKS cluster.

The `cluster_endpoint_public_access_cidrs` variable is set to a list of CIDR blocks that are allowed to access the Kubernetes API server endpoint of the cluster.

The `vpc_id` variable is set to the `vpc_id` output variable of the `module.vpc` module. This specifies the ID of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in which the EKS cluster should be created.

The `subnet_ids` variable is set to the `private_subnets` output variable of the `module.vpc` module. This specifies the list of subnet IDs where the EKS worker nodes should be launched.

```hcl
  eks_managed_node_group_defaults = {
    ami_type = "AL2_x86_64"

    attach_cluster_primary_security_group = true

    disk_size      = 100

    # Disabling and using externally provided security groups
    create_security_group = false
  }
```

In this section, the code defines the default configuration for the managed node groups in the EKS cluster. The `eks_managed_node_group_defaults` block specifies various parameters:

- `ami_type` is set to `"AL2_x86_64"`, indicating the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) type to use for the worker nodes. Here, it's using the Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) AMI.
- `attach_cluster_primary_security_group` is set to `true`, which allows the managed node groups to use the security group associated with the EKS cluster.
- `disk_size` is set to `100`, specifying the size of the root EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume in gigabytes for the worker nodes.
- `create_security_group` is set to `false`, indicating that externally provided security groups will be used instead of creating a new one.

```hcl
  eks_managed_node_groups = {
    ng-8c16g = {
      create_launch_template = false
      launch_template_name   = ""

      name = "node-group-c5-2xlarge"

      instance_types = ["c5.2xlarge"]

      disk_size      = 100

      min_size     = 3
      max_size     = 10
      desired_size = 6

      vpc_security_group_ids = [
        aws_security_group.node_group_one.id
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this section, the code defines the configuration for the managed node groups within the EKS cluster. The `eks_managed_node_groups` block specifies a map where each key represents the name of the node group, and the corresponding

 value is a block containing the configuration for that node group.

In the example above, there is one node group defined with the key `ng-8c16g`. The block defines the following parameters:

- `create_launch_template` is set to `false`, indicating that a launch template won't be created for this node group.
- `launch_template_name` is set to an empty string, as a launch template is not being used.
- `name` is set to `"node-group-c5-2xlarge"`, providing a name for the node group.
- `instance_types` is set to `["c5.2xlarge"]`, specifying the instance types to be used for the worker nodes in this node group.
- `disk_size` is set to `100`, specifying the size of the root EBS volume in gigabytes for the worker nodes in this node group.
- `min_size`, `max_size`, and `desired_size` specify the minimum, maximum, and desired number of worker nodes in the node group, respectively.
- `vpc_security_group_ids` is set to a list of security group IDs. Here, it references `aws_security_group.node_group_one.id`, which is assumed to be an existing security group created elsewhere in the Terraform code.

Please note that the code snippet includes commented-out blocks (`two` block) that are not currently in use. Those blocks can be uncommented and configured as needed to define additional managed node groups in the EKS cluster.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the code structure and its corresponding configurations. Let me know if you have any further questions!
